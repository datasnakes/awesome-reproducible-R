# awesome-reproducible-R [![Awesome][awesome-badge]](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

An awesome list of resources for reproducible research in R, which includes a comparison table of different tools.

## Labels

This awesome list contains sections that qualify a list item based on it's __primary feature__.  However, some items might have multiple features or uncommon features.  In order to account for this, we have provided a system of acronyms that will be used to label each item.  Additionally, many of the acronyms describe the items as proprietary or native based on how closely they rely on existing R based technologies.  In the next section we list these qualifying acronyms, and give details on what they are meant to convey.

### Comprehensive Tools

These packages or frameworks incorporate package, project, and data management into one tool/

- [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) - The goal of rrtools is to provide instructions, templates, and functions for making a basic compendium suitable for writing reproducible research with R
- [RSuite](https://rsuite.io) - R Suite is an R package which together with R Suite CLI tool enables you to design deployment workflow that fits you and makes R your primary data science platform.

### Package Management

These tools are designed to manage packages or package repositories.

- [reproducible](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/reproducible) – A set of tools for R that enhance reproducibility beyond package management.

### Project Management

These tools are designed to manage projects.

- [template](https://github.com/Pakillo/template) – A template for research projects structured as R packages.
- [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) -  Organize your project into a research website.
- [ProjectTemplate](https://github.com/KentonWhite/ProjectTemplate) - Automatically build a directory for a new R project with a standardized subdirectory structure.

### Data Management

These tools are designed to manage data.

- [DataPackageR](https://github.com/ropensci/DataPackageR) – An R package to enable reproducible data processing, packaging and sharing.
